Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.



class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int min =INT_MAX;
        int max =0;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.size();i++)
        {
            if(prices[i]<min)
            {
                min=prices[i];
            }
            else if(prices[i]-min > max)
            {
                max = prices[i]-min;
            }
        }
        return max;
        
    }
};
